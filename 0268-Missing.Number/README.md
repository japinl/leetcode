# 268. Missing Number

Given an array containing `n` distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`,
find the one that is missing from the array.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```

__Note:__

Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it
using only constant extra space complexity?
