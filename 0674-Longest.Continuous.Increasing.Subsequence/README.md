# 674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous
increasing subsequence (subarray).

__Example 1:__

```
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3.
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1.
```
__Note:__ Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.
