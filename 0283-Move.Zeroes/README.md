# 283. Move Zeroes

Given an array `nums`, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while
maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

__Example:__

```
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

__Note:__

1. You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
2. Minimize the total number of operations.
