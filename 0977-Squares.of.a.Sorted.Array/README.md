# 977. Squares of a Sorted Array

Given an array of integers `A` sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array
of the squares of each number, also in sorted non-decreasing order.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```
 
__Note:__

1. `1 <= A.length <= 10000`
2. `-10000 <= A[i] <= 10000`
3. `A` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
