# 561. Array Partition I

Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n
pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of
min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: [1,4,3,2]

Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
```

__Note:__

1. n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
2. All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].


__Hint 1__

Obviously, brute force won't help here. Think of something else, take some
example like 1,2,3,4.

__Hint 2__

How will you make pairs to get the result? There must be some pattern.

__Hint 3__

How will you make pairs to get the result? There must be some pattern.

__Hint 4__

How will you make pairs to get the result? There must be some pattern.
