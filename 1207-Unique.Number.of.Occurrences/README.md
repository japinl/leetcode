# 1207. Unique Number of Occurrences

Given an array of integers `arr`, write a function that returns `true` if and
only if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: false
```

__Example 3:__

```
Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
Output: true
```

__Constraints:__

* `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
* `-1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
