# 1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences

Given a string `s` consisting only of letters `'a'` and `'b'`. In a
single step you can remove one palindromic __subsequence__ from `s`.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by
deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward
as well as forward.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: String is already palindrome
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: s = "abb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".
```

__Example 3:__

```
Input: s = "baabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".
```

__Constraints:__

* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s[i]` is either `'a'` or `'b'`.
