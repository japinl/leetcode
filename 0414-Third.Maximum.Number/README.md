# 414. Third Maximum Number

Given a __non-empty__ array of integers, return the __third__ maximum number in
this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity
must be in O(n).

__Example 1:__

```
Input: [3, 2, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: [1, 2]
Output: 2
Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
```

__Example 3:__

```
Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
```
